		<p>To have a good style, it's important to limit the colors: 2-3 colors. The colors should be similar and go well together, such as: black, grey, and white; blue and pink; burgundy and greyâ€¦ It is preferable not to mix colors like: green, yellow, pink, orange, red, and purple together, and to combine these colors with neutral colors such as: grey, beige, white, and black. To make your outfit perfect, it is necessary to add accessories such as: jewelry, a handbag, or glasses. It is better not to wear too many accessories. It is essential that the jewelry be made of stainless steel because: it does not degrade, it does not leave marks, it lasts, and it looks better.</p>
